  "skillVisualPrompt": "A thick, high-pressure pillar of cerulean water erupts horizontally on a green screen #00FF00. The water has a dense, viscous liquid texture with sharp white pixel highlights and dark blue outlines. The animation features a 12-frame linear thrust where the water column maintains a solid, metallic-like surface tension while surging forward.",
  "sfxPrompt": "A heavy white-noise burst for the initial pressure release followed by a deep, low-frequency sine-wave thud to simulate the physical weight of the water hitting a solid surface.",
